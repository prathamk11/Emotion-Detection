# **Image Detection using TensorFlow**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on **image detection** using **TensorFlow**. The goal is to develop a deep learning model capable of identifying objects in images. We will use a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** along with **pre-trained models** for accurate classification.

---

## **Dataset Selection**
A relevant dataset for image detection should include:
- Labeled images of different objects/categories.
- A diverse range of images with varying backgrounds and lighting conditions.

You can find datasets from:
- **Kaggle** (e.g., COCO dataset, ImageNet, Open Images Dataset)
- **TensorFlow Datasets**
- **Custom dataset** (collected and labeled manually)

## **Steps to Build the Model**

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Load images and convert them into tensors.
- Normalize pixel values to the range [0,1].
- Augment data (flipping, rotation, scaling) to improve model generalization.

### **2. Choosing a Model**
- Use a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** for feature extraction.
- Utilize **pre-trained models** like:
  - **MobileNetV2** (lightweight and fast)
  - **VGG16** (deep and accurate)
  - **ResNet50** (residual learning for better performance)

### **3. Training the Model**
- Split dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)**.
- Compile the model using **categorical crossentropy loss** and **Adam optimizer**.
- Train using **TensorFlow & Keras**, monitoring accuracy and loss.

### **4. Model Evaluation**
- Use **Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.
- Validate model performance on unseen images.

### **5. Model Deployment**
- Convert the trained model to **TensorFlow SavedModel format**.
- Deploy using **Flask or FastAPI** to create an API for image upload and detection.
